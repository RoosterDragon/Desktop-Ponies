Description, "Try to kick the ball into your opponent's goal! You can either watch the ponies play by themselves, or take part by right-clicking a pony and selecting 'take control'! Player 1 uses the arrow keys (movement), right shift (run), and right control (kick toward goal) keys. Player 2 uses the WASD keys (movement), left shift (run), and left control (kick toward goal) keys. Note that you can only kick once every two seconds! Make it count!"
