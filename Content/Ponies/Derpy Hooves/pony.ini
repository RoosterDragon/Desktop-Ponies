'Derpy Hooves config file
'v1.4
'By RJP!
'Original pony template by Jay Wright
'Cloud bounce by The Coop
'Behavior parameters:
'Name (can be anything),
'Relative Probability (0.1 = 10%),
'Max Duration (seconds)
'Min Duration (seconds)
'Movement Speed (Pixel's per tick - one tick = 100msec)
'Animation/Image name (.jpg, .png, .gif) - not all gifs may work.
'Movement allowed:  None (stand still), Horizontal_only, Vertical_Only, Horizontal_Vertical, Diagonal_Only
'                     Diagonal_Horizontal, Diagonal_Vertical, all
' OPTIONAL BEHAVIOR PARAMETERS
'   (you can leave these out completely, but if you include one you must include the rest)
'Linked Behavior - the name of another behavior that will be started as soon as the current one ends.
'   (try not to make any infinite pony loops)  (leave blank for nothing)
'Starting Line - The number of the "Speak" entry to use at the start of this behavior.
'   (leave blank for nothing)
'Ending line - The number of the "Speak" entry to use at the end of the behavior.
'  (leave blank for nothing)
'Skip_normally = true if this behavior shouldn't be used if not for a linked behavior chain, default = false
'  (meaning, normally you would leave this false for the start of a chain, and true for the rest of it)
'  (this also makes the probability option pointless for this behavior)
'   if you want the behavior to head somewhere in particular:
'x_coordinate (in % of screen width), 0 for not used
'y_coordinate (in % of screen height), 0 for not used
'  (a pony will go to this coordinate on their current screen, unless trying
'   to find another pony)
'  optional parameter:
'   name of a particular pony, or effect, to follow (coordinates when specifying an object to follow change meaning into the offset from the target)
'idle
'sleep
'trotting
'flying
'hovering
'derpy flying and hovering
'grab mailbag
'flying with mail
'put away mailbag
'muffin time
'follow Raindrops
'cloud bounce
'Lines for the pony to say (when hovered over, or small random chance
'Effects:
'
'effect parameters:
'effect name
'behavior name to be associated with
'image to use going right
'image to use going left
'duration to stay on screen (0 means stay as long as the behavior is there)
'repeat delay, in seconds (0 means display only once)
'location relative to pony to place the effect (going right):
'    options:
'	top_right
'	top_left
'	bottom_right
'	bottom_left
'	center
'	top
'	bottom
'	left
'	right
'centering of effect image going right (you probably just want "center" unless the effect image is large)
'       (this is to make sure that large effects don't overlap with ponies.)
'       (options same as previous parameter)
'location going left
'centering going right
'follow - true: follow the pony, false = stay still (dropped behind)
